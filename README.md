# Template for Vectis plugin

[Vectis] is an account abstraction infrastructure currently implemented in Cosmwasm.

This template is a starting point for developers to build plugins to extend the features of Vectis Accounts.

The NYMLAB team will be in HackWasm Berlin 2023, if you would like to hack on this, reach us at http://discord.vectis.space/

To see an example of a plugin extending the use of [CronCat], see this [video].

[More to follow soon].
